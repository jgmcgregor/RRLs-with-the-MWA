# RRLs-with-the-MWA
A repository containing all the code I have created or significantly modified for my ICRAR summer project searching for radio recombination lines with the MWA

These scripts were all run after the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) data had been processed with the GLEAM-X pipeline (https://github.com/tjgalvin/GLEAM-X-pipeline) and the MWA spectral line pipeline (https://github.com/nhurleywalker/MWA-spectral-line-pipeline), with minor modifications made to suit my project. 
This repository includes scripts used to mosaic the processed observations into one cube, and scripts used to create plots used in my final report.
